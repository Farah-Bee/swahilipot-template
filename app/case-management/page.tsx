                At the Swahili Pot Hub Foundation (SPH), we are committed to
                making a positive impact on the lives of young individuals in
                Mombasa County and its six sub-counties. For the past seven
                years, we have been dedicated to helping youth overcome
                challenges and thrive.

                The primary objective of the Case Management Project is to
                connect 60,000 youth in Mombasa County and its sub-counties to a
                wide range of opportunities and sustainable employment.
